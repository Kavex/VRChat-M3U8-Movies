**Suggested**

[UBlock Orgin](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm)

Really suggested to have a popup blocker because some of these sites are questionable with Ads.

[Privacy Badger](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/privacy-badger/pkehgijcmpdhfbdbbnkijodmdjhbjlgp)

A good antivirus that blocks questionable popup links like https://www.avast.com/en-us/index#pc


**URLS**

[nepu.to](https://nepu.to/)

[fmoviesz.to](https://fmoviesz.to/) (has some nasty ADs without suggested)


[Aniwave.to](https://aniwave.to/) 

**How to**

1. Start playing to video on the site
2. Click on the M3u8 finder and hls-player Extention

3. Copy the URL and paste it into the VRChat Video Player in Streaming Mode
