How to grab movies for VRChat's Video Player

**Requirements**

Latest Chrome

[M3u8 finder and hls-player Extention](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/m3u8-finder-and-hls-playe/gijhpnmjcpbddpedmmdihijogkkejfgj) 

**Suggested**

[UBlock Orgin](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm)

Really suggested to have a popup blocker because some of these sites are questionable with Ads.

A good antivirus that blocks questionable popup links like https://www.avast.com/en-us/index#pc


**URLS**

https://fmoviesz.to/

https://nepu.to/

**How to**

1. Start playing to video on the site
2. Click on the M3u8 finder and hls-player Extention

3. Copy the URL and paste it into the VRChat Video Player in Streaming Mode

If you are using fmoviez.to sometimes you need to pick a different host
